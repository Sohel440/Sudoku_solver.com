# SUDOKU SOLVER 
The Automated Sudoku Generator & Solver Web App is a fully web-based application that autonomously generates a Sudoku puzzle and solves it in real-time. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application provides an engaging and interactive experience for users who want to observe how Sudoku puzzles are solved programmatically. Unlike traditional Sudoku solvers that require user input, this application automatically generates a new puzzle, displays it, and instantly solves it using an efficient algorithm.  When the page loads, the system randomly generates a valid Sudoku puzzle with varying difficulty levels. The puzzle is displayed in a neatly designed 9Ã—9 grid, styled using CSS for clarity and readability. Once the puzzle is generated, the JavaScript-powered backtracking algorithm automatically processes the grid and fills in the missing numbers in real-time, demonstrating how an AI-based solver tackles a Sudoku problem step by step. The solution is displayed dynamically, making it an educational and visually appealing experience.  The application is designed with a modern and responsive UI, ensuring a smooth experience across different screen sizes. JavaScript handles both the puzzle generation and solving process, providing an intuitive demonstration of algorithmic problem-solving. Additionally, users can click a button to generate a new puzzle, watch the solving process again, or slow down the solving speed for better visualization.  This Automated Sudoku Generator & Solver Web App serves as both an entertainment and learning tool, offering insight into Sudoku-solving algorithms without requiring any user interaction. It is perfect for developers, puzzle enthusiasts, and anyone interested in seeing how computers solve logic-based problems in real time.
